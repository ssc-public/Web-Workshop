This is a primitive blog application. <br/>
The aim of the project is to have a minimalistic yet extensible fullstack project template in case needed. <br/>
Frontend and backend loosely coupled. <br/>
I tried to keep the project layout as clean as possible. <br/>
It's (almost) production ready. <br/>

Stack: <br/>
Python / Django Rest Framework for API <br/>
JS/ React-Redux for Frontend <br/>
Docker for container <br/>
Gunicorn and nginx for production server<br/>

You can give it a try :

Set args values in docker-compose.yml file to your host ip and run <br/>

`docker-compose up`
